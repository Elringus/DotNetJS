## What is this?

A clone of [@microsoft/dotnet-js-interop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@microsoft/dotnet-js-interop) modified to be used in any environment (browser, node.js, webview, etc). The library is used as a component for interop between .NET and JavaScript.

## Why?

Microsoft is not planning to support any environment, except browser: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/38208
